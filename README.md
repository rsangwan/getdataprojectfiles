#Getting and Cleaning Data Project

##Repository contents

1. README.md: this file
2. Codebook.md: for the datafile tidy-data-set.txt
3. run_analysis.R: R script that creates tidy-data-set.txt
4. tidy-data-set.txt: space delimited tidy data set generated by the R script run_analysis.R

##Processing steps in run_analysis.R

**Step 1:** Reads test (*X_test.txt*, *y_test.txt*, *subject_test.txt*) and training (*X_train.txt*, *y_train.txt*, *subject_train.txt*) data sets from the current directory 

**Step 2:** Merges these data sets appropriately naming the variables using labels from *features.txt*

**Step 3:** Extracts only those variables that contain the mean and standard deviation for each measurement

**Step 4:** Gives descriptive activity names to the activities in the data set using labels from *activity_labels.txt*

**Step 5:** Creates a tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject

**Step 6:** Writes the tidy data set to a text file *tidy-data-set.txt*
